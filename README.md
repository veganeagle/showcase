# Gus Scaiano – Technical Showcase - WIP

This repository contains selected code samples demonstrating my hands-on technical capabilities. These are simplified 
illustrations taken from two active personal projects:

- **kdSay** – a real-time translation and communication platform built on Google Cloud.
- **OPSci.ca** – an AI-driven analytics project providing insight into Ontario public sector data.

As a banking and technology executive, I focus on building scalable platforms, 
modernizing architectures, and applying data-driven decisioning. This repository showcases 
coding style, clarity of thinking, and architectural approaches, while excluding any proprietary 
or confidential work.

## Repository Contents

### 1. `kdsay-demo/`
