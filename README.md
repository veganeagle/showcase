# Gus Scaiano – Technical Showcase

This repository contains small samples illustrating my coding style 
and recent work. These are simplified demos representing 
larger real-world projects I’ve built, including a real-time 
translation platform (kdSay) and AI-powered analytics tools 
(OPSci.ca). Proprietary codebases remain private.

## Contents
- kdsay-demo: Springboot Java back-end for real-time translation.
- opsci-demo: Data engineering and analytics examples (pandas).
- misc-samples: Various small code samples in Python/Java.
